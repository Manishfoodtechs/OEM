The name \"OEM\" stands for \r\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer, because the framework is also intended to be \r\nunbranded and generic. It supports multi-domain, multi-app setups from the same \r\ncodebase and is built using modern PHP features, such as namespaces and \r\nauto-loading. It requires PHP 5.3+ and Apache with support for .htaccess and \r\nmod_rewrite.\r\n\r\nAll the intellectual property in this project is released into the public \r\ndomain, to avoid the problem of licencing. You can modify the framework in any \r\nway you like, brand it, sell it as a product, or claim that you’ve developed it \r\nyourself — I don’t mind.\r\n\r\nIf you’re an inexperienced PHP web developer, you are encouraged to look around \r\nand poke at things, but please consider a more mainstream framework (like Zend \r\nFramework, CakePHP, or Symphony) that will usually provide a gentler learning \r\ncurve, better documentation, and easy to use features.\r\n\r\nAs of August 2012 the project has just started, although the code has been \r\nalready used in several projects of my own. If you wish to contribute, please \r\nuse [Github](https://github.com/pies/OEM). Thanks and good luck :)\r\n\r\nMy name is Michal Tatarynowicz, I'm a web developer. In the past I've started \r\nand lead the CakePHP project.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"A simple PHP 5.3 multi-site framework for small and medium size web apps."}
