## Welcome to OEM

OEM is a rather simple, liberally licenced framework for programmers needing to 
create medium-complexity, custom web applications. The name "OEM" stands for 
Original Equipment Manufacturer, because the framework is also intended to be 
unbranded and generic. It supports multi-domain, multi-app setups from the same 
codebase and is built using modern PHP features, such as namespaces and 
auto-loading. It requires PHP 5.3+ and Apache with support for .htaccess and 
mod_rewrite.

All the intellectual property in this project is released into the public 
domain, to avoid the problem of licencing. You can modify the framework in any 
way you like, brand it, sell it as a product, or claim that you’ve developed it 
yourself — I don’t mind.

If you’re an inexperienced PHP web developer, you are encouraged to look around 
and poke at things, but please consider a more mainstream framework (like Zend 
Framework, CakePHP, or Symphony) that will usually provide a gentler learning 
curve, documentation, and easy to use features.

As of August 2012 the project has just started, although the code has been 
already used in several projects of my own. If you wish to contribute, please 
use Github https://github.com/pies/OEM-3 . Thanks and good luck :)

My name is Michal Tatarynowicz, I'm a web developer. In the past I've started 
and lead the CakePHP project.
